# MINT
MINT is a Math INTerpreter.  I created it as a personal exercise, but also put it up here in case it might be useful for someone else.  It is heavily inspired by [ROOT 5](https://root.cern.ch/), which I used during my studies.  You can enter mathematical expressions and have them evaluated, all at runtime.  You can check out other mathematical expression parsers at [this benchmark](https://code.google.com/p/math-parser-benchmark-project/).
